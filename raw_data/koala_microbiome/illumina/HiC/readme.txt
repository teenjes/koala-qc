#Special comments:
Craig is a male koala (likely large, scat was large and dry)
Tahlia is a female koala (likely half size of Craig, scat was very small and fresh)
inputs microbiome scat 100 mg
extra attention to cleaning with CRB
switched to our own home-made beads to enable bigger volumes and more washing
