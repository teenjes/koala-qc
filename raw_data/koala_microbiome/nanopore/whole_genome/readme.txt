#Special comments:
Grind 3 poos (1.5-3 g) mortar and pestle.
sorbitol wash
Bead based extraction (above)
2x chloro clean
Pippin prep 15 kb +
Barcoded MinION seq in house

measuring DNA concentartion seemed very dificult until clean
first failed attempts were form circulomics and non chloro cleaned samples.
Both chloro clean and pippin were necessary.
